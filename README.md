# java-tdd-boilerplate

In one coding-session on the last /dev/night we struggled a bit 
to get a phpunit system up and running and I thought that providing some
point to start from could be helpful.

Execute Readme.java for some basic info.

Finally there's nothing else to say then: 
Happy Testing ;-)
