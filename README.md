# java-tdd-boilerplate

In one coding-session on the last */dev/night* we struggled a bit 
to get a phpunit system up and running and I thought that providing some
point to start from could be helpful.

As I am the *"java guy"* from the people I met in Ansbach so far, this is my contribution, 
maybe some of the php-folks or whoever want's to join?

## Setup
You have to install java on your system first. [Installing Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html) is also recommended.

1. run `gradle dependencies` in the root path of the folder
2. run `gradle build` to build the project

Finally, execute **Readme.java** for some basic info.

Finally there's nothing else to say then: 
Happy Testing ;-)
