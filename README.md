# java-tdd-boilerplate

In one coding-session on the last */dev/night* we struggled a bit 
to get a phpunit system up and running and I thought that providing some
point to start from could be helpful.

As I am the *"java guy"* from the people I met in Ansbach so far, this is my contribution, 
maybe some of the php-folks or whoever want's to join?

Execute **Readme.java** for some basic info.

Finally there's nothing else to say then: 
Happy Testing ;-)
